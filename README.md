# Flugblatt-Generator
Creating simple lamp post flyers on the fly with PHP and FPDF.


<h2>How it works</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The user fills out a form (title, description, contact details).</li>
  <li>A picture can be added. Otherwise a generic image is used.</li>
  <li>After the user submits, the flyer pdf is generated and opened in the browser.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What could be improved</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Including individual fonts.</li>
  <li>Improving the style.</li>
  <li>Option to send the pdf via e-mail.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Thanks</h2>
